//! The lib registry: the names of the lib, and what each declares. It is
//! embedded from the registry file and the proposers file, as
//! [`REGISTRY_TEXT`] and [`PROPOSERS_TEXT`], when the engine is compiled, so
//! the wheel reads no file for it. A new lib element adds a
//! registry entry and changes no checker code.
//!
//! # The file
//!
//! The file is `engine/lib/registry.sexpr`. It is s-expressions, read by the
//! reader of [`crate::read::read_sexprs`], so the engine has one reader for
//! every s-expression file. `include_str!` puts its text into the compiled
//! crate, and [`Registry::get`] reads that text once, on first use. The test
//! `registry_file` under `engine/arclog/tests/` parses both lib files, so a
//! fault of either fails `cargo test`.
//!
//! Each top-level form declares one lib element, by its head:
//!
//! - `(relation <name> (columns (<Column> <type>) ...) (modes (<Column> ...) ...))`:
//!   an algebra relation, the group relations and `pose_difference`
//!   included. Each mode lists the columns, other than an orientation
//!   type's, that must be grounded for the relation to ground the others; a
//!   relation over a finite domain has no `modes` form, and no mode is empty.
//! - `(component <name> <construction|detector|task-structure> (type-parameters <t> ...)
//!   (inputs (<input> (<column> <type>) ... [(default <rows>)] [reads-outputs]) ...)
//!   (outputs (<output> (<column> <type>) ...) ...))`: a construction, a
//!   detector or a task-structure component, its inputs in the order the component declares them. An
//!   input's `default` writes its rows as a `param` form writes them after
//!   its types (`docs/arclog/arcdata.md#params`): each row as a list of its
//!   values, and the rows of a relation with a Position or an Offset column
//!   as a grid. An
//!   input marked `reads-outputs` reads the instance's outputs, as
//!   `Unfold`'s `step`, `skip` and `take` do. An output may share its name
//!   with an input of the same form: an instance's output of that name reads
//!   the input's relation, as `Unfold`'s `take`, where the instance writes no
//!   clause for it, holds the item of least `score`.
//! - `(proposer <name> native (columns (<Column> <type>) ...))`: a native
//!   proposer, such as a domain proposer.
//! - `(proposer <name> arclog)`: a proposer written in arclog, whose clause
//!   stands in `engine/lib/proposers.arclog`. Its columns are its clause's
//!   labels, in the order they first stand in the clause.
//! - `(derivation <Name> (fields (<Field> <type>) ...) (columns (<Column> <type>) ...))`:
//!   a fixed derivation of a table, its row's fields and the table's columns.
//!   A derivation may share its name with a component, as `Frame` and
//!   `Division` do.
//! - `(constants <type> <NAME> ...)`: the constants of an orientation type,
//!   and `(constants C4 <NAME> ...)`: the D4 constants that are C4, the
//!   rotations.
//! - `(fact <name> (columns (<Column> <type>) ...))`: the columns of a fact
//!   relation, `input`, `ex_input` or `ex_output`, the Example column `E`
//!   first in the two of the examples.
//! - `(macro <name> (columns (<Column> <type> <Label>) ...) (modes ...) <body>)`:
//!   a lib relation that the lib defines from other lib names, each column with its type and the label of the definition
//!   it stands for, its modes as a `relation` form gives them, and its
//!   definition.
//! - `(macro <name> (component ...) [(INIT ...)] (output <port> (<Label> ...) <body>) ...)`:
//!   a cell instance, its declaration as a `component` form gives it, the
//!   `INIT` form of the underlying construction where it has one, and a body
//!   for each of its outputs, as [`Macro::CellInstance`] gives. Within these
//!   bodies an atom `(self.<port> <sites>)` reads the cell instance's own
//!   input `<port>`, as [`crate::program::RelationRef::DefinedPort`] holds it.
//!
//! A macro's definition reads only lib names that a form of the file
//! declares, and a definition that reads another name is a fault of the
//! file.
//!
//! A `<type>` is a type name of [`crate::program::TypeName`], `Pose` for
//! the assembly the read names, `shared-pose` for one assembly's Pose type
//! at each such column of the relation, `(pose-or <type>)` for the type or
//! the Pose type of the label at the site, or a type parameter of its
//! component. The file declares no `representative`. The file and
//! `engine/lib/proposers.arclog` are named in diagnostics as
//! [`crate::layout::SourceFile::LibRegistry`] and
//! [`crate::layout::SourceFile::LibProposers`].
//!
//! `engine/lib/proposers.arclog` holds one form `(proposer <Name> <atom> ...)`
//! per proposer of the form `(proposer <name> arclog)`, its name in the
//! spelling of a proposer, as `(proposer DominantColor ...)`, then the atoms
//! of its clause's body, which [`crate::read::read_body`] reads.
//!
//! The registry and resolver stage writes the bodies and the file's entries.
